This folder contains examples of user personas for both fictional and real companies.

The **goal** is to demonstrate my ability to create thorough, relevant customer personas that inform user-centered content creation and product development.

The **content** of the user personas features demographic, psychographic, technical background, and usage scenarios.

The **scope** includes creating a wide range of user personas that are relevat to both technical documentation and product development.

The **customer pain points** include a lack of understanding customer needs, developing products that do not meet user expectations, and increased support requests due to usability issues.

My **motivations** are to improve the effectiveness of technical documentation while providing a clear and consistent understanding of target customers.
