# Yu-TechwritingPortfolio

My technical writing portfolio showcases a range of work designed to empower users with clear, effective communication. Examples are separated by **USER PERSONA'S** to demonstrate my understanding of user needs, **REVISED DOCUMENTATION** that highlights my ability to improve existing content, and **API DOCUMENTATION** that communicates clearly and precisely to developers. 

The **objective** of this portfolio is to highlight the practical value of my technical writing and provide clear examples of my ability to create effective documentation.

The **scope** of this portfolio showcases my ability to improve upon existing technical documentation and craft original user personas, which reflects a comprehensive approach to user-focused content.

My approach to documentation includes a strong emphasis on user feedback. In order to continuously improve upon my portfolio, please reach out with any feedback or points of confusion.
