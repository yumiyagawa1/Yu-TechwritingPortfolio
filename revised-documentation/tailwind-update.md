## Getting Started with Tailwind CSS (Play CDN)

**Original Link:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn)

**Revised Instructions (Following Google Developers Style Guide Principles):**

**Goal:** Try Tailwind CSS directly in your browser without a build step using the Play CDN.

**Important:** The Play CDN is for development only and should not be used in production.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Add the Play CDN script to your HTML:**

    - To style your content with Tailwind's utility classes, add the Play CDN script tag to the `<head>` of your HTML file.

2.  **Apply custom CSS:**
    - To add custom CSS that supports all of Tailwind's features, use `type="text/tailwindcss"`.

**Reflections:**

- When explaining a procedure, state the purpose or goal of the action before stating the action.
- Place conditions before instructions.
- Start section headlines with imperative verbs (e.g., "Add," "Apply").
- Removed the word "try" from the headings.
- Rewrote the introduction to follow the recommended procedure.
