## Getting Started with Tailwind CSS (Play CDN)

### **Introduction**
The following showcases improvements I've made to the existing official Tailwind CSS documentation using the Google Developer Style Guide as a a reference point. The updates include a "Before" and "After" comparison, along with a brief explanation for my changes.

The **goal** of this documentation is to improve the user experience, demonstrate style guide application, and enhance long-term maintainability. The **scope** specifically address the Play CDN installation section of the Tailwind CSS documentation. The **pain points** I am trying to resolve include a lack of clarity, structural inconsistencies, and improving information accessibility.

**User feedback** this current documentation is a work in progress. If you've used the Tailwind CSS Play CDN or have suggestions for further improvements, please don't hesitate to suggest improvements.

**Before** <br>
Use the Play CDN to try Tailwind right in the browser without any build step. The Play CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is not intended for production.

1: Add the Play CDN script to your HTML
Add the Play CDN script tag to the <head> of your HTML file, and start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

2: Try adding some custom CSS
Use type="text/tailwindcss" to add custom CSS that supports all of Tailwind's CSS features.

**After**

To try Tailwind right in the browser without any build step, use the Play CDN. The Play CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is not intended for production.

1: Style your content with utility classes
To use Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content, add the Play CDN script tag to the <head> of your HTML file.

2: Apply custom CSS
To add custom CSS that supports all of Tailwind’s CSS features, use type=“text/tailwindcss”.

**Reasoning for my edits:**

- When explaining a procedure, state the purpose or goal of the action before explaining the action.
- Place conditions before instructions.
- Start section headlines with imperative verbs (e.g., "Add," "Apply"). I also removed the word "try" from the headings as it is a weak verb.

 These changes aim to provide a more streamlined and understandable installation process for Tailwind CSS users. By incorporating user feedback, I hope to continue to improve the documentation's overall effectiveness.
