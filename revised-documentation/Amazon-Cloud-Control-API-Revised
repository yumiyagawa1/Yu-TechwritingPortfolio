# AWS Cloud Control API

### **Introduction**

The following showcases improvements I've made to Amazon's official Cloud Control API. The updates include a "Before" and "After" comparison, along with a brief explanation for my changes.

The **goal** of my updates include improving the user experience by adding structure and enhancing readability. The **scope** of this work is specifically limited to the Cloud Control API documentation. Key **pain points** addressed include resolving a lack of clarity, structural inconsistencies, and information accessibility.

**User feedback**: this documentation is continually being refined. If you have experience with the Cloud Control API or suggestions for further improvements, please feel free to submit your revisions or comments.

**Current documentation:**

Cloud Control API provides you with centralized control over the resources in your AWS account and a consistent way of accessing and provisioning those resources. It provides a uniform programmatic interface for making calls directly to the various resource types available in your AWS account.

A resource type represents an artifact that can be provisioned through a web service: an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instance, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, or even an entire web application. Each resource type uses a standardized syntax to support some or all the following lifecycle events: create, read, update, delete, and list (CRUD-L). You can directly invoke these CRUD-L event handlers using Cloud Control API as a consistent set of APIs.

Amazon has published several hundred resource types representing offerings across AWS web services. Now, third-party publishers can make their own resource types available for use as well. Any resource type developed using the AWS CloudFormation CLI open-source tool is automatically supported by Cloud Control API.

## Introduction

The AWS Cloud Control API offers centralized control over resources within your AWS account. It provides a consistent, programmatic interface for accessing and provisioning these resources, allowing you to interact directly with various resource types through a uniform API.

## What is a Resource Type?

A resource type represents a provisionable artifact within a web service. Examples include:

- An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance
- An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instance
- An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy
- An entire web application

Each resource type adheres to a standardized syntax, supporting some or all of the following lifecycle events:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
- List (CRUD-L)

You can directly invoke these CRUD-L event handlers using Cloud Control API as a consistent set of APIs.

## How to Create Your Own Resource Type

AWS provides hundreds of resource types representing various AWS web service offerings. Now, third-party publishers can also create and make their own resource types available. Resource types developed using the AWS CloudFormation CLI open-source tool are automatically compatible with the Cloud Control API.
